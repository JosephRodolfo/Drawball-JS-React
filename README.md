# Drawball/Procedurally Generated (Blank) Infinite World for Painting

This is kind of a mix of Drawball (similar to Reddit's r/place) and a minecraft world in that players can walk around a seemingly infinite world and shared world and create (draw) a limited but regerating quantity of ink. It'll be made with Javascript, React, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, Express, websockets, etc. 

The main goal is to get more comfortable doing some more complicated javascript on a larger scale, with a focus on organization and seperating programming concerns. I'll also use Oath with signing in with Google for accounts. Also since it's a theoretically infinite world I'll have to play more attention to performance and size than I have in the past.
